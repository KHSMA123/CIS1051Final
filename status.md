Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've managed to make a working oscillator and switchable wavetable synthesizer. I ran all of the calculations for each wave manually since there isn't a way to automatically display it in the wave display. I also built the UI for the entire plugin and the interface for the volume control

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
Coded the effects modules and made them pass through, as well as link the volume control to the faders

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Distorting the sound without the cpu overloading a little (just need to reduce the processes or change the way I designed it), and get every effect to passthrough the dry signal with the inlet/outlet block
