# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fully Functional Wavetable Synthesizer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Uses MIDI information to generate sounds.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use PureData to create a working synthesizer. It will hopefully be able to function similar to well known progams like Massive or Serum on a basic level. The coding environment is basic so UI might be a little rough but I hope to make an easy to use interface with buttons (hide messy code as well).
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Build a tone generator
Make it midi-input compatible (if you have midi inputs the signal is read)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add a wavetable function that switches between basic waves and an adjustable volume meter AND control to monitor sound output.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add an Effects
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to code in a "Well known" (for the music industry) musical and logic-based programming language (PD). Learning the basics of building a synthesizer in a software environment is going to be the most challenging as well. I will also have to teach myself how to code effects plugins and allow for a dry/wet signal instead of just overriding the signal entirely.
